# ApiRandomLLM
Random API created using fastapi and python.

Â¿How to make this work?
- We need to have a hugging face account
- We need to request for the token (with read access)

Execute locally this command:
```python -m uvicorn main:app --reload```

And run the example curl to test it:

```sh curl.sh```
